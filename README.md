## Introduction 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 109 million people that live there, 57 million (52% of the
population) do not have access to a dependable supply of water that
is securely managed, and 43 million (39%) do not have access to
home sanitary facilities that are safely managed. Despite its
increasing economy, the Philippines confronts substantial water and
sanitation access difficulties. The country is quickly urbanizing, and
its expanding cities are struggling to provide appropriate water and
sanitation facilities to new citizens[^1].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Two billion people lack safe drinking water, more than twice lack safe sanitation**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK, 17 July 2017 – Some 3 in 10 people worldwide, or 2.1 billion, lack access to safe drinking water at home; and 6 in 10, or 4.4 billion people lack safely managed sanitation, according to a new report by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report, Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and Sustainable Development Goal Baselines, released last week, presents the first global assessment of “safely managed” drinking water and sanitation services, particularly in rural areas.[^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Safe water, sanitation and hygiene at home should not be a privilege of only those who are rich or live in urban centres,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These are some of the most basic requirements for human health, and all countries have a responsibility to ensure that everyone can access them.”[^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billions of people globally have gained access to basic drinking water and sanitation services since 2000, but these do not necessarily provide safe water and sanitation. Many homes, healthcare facilities and schools still lack soap and water for handwashing; putting people’s health – especially young children – at risk for diseases, such as diarrhoea. As a result, every year 361,000 children under 5 years old die due to diarrhoea. Poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid.[^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Philippines, 91% of the country’s estimated 100.7 million population have access to at least basic water services; but access is highly inequitable across the country, with regional basic water services access ranging from 62% to 100%. Around 99% of the one-fifth wealthiest households are more likely to have access to basic water services; while only 80% of the poorest quintile do.[^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 6 million Filipinos also still practice open defecation, and some 20 million lack access to basic sanitation facilities. While over 75 million Filipinos have basic sanitation service at the national level, there are significant inequalities, particularly with regional coverage ranging only from 22% to 86%.[^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities are essential to health and wellness in the communities. Safe water and sanitation is especially linked to young children’s nutrition and ability to stay healthy and focused in school. Diseases caused by unsafe or unhygienic practices decrease children’s chances to successful school completion and healthy growth,” said UNICEF Philippines Representative Lotta Sylwander. “In rural areas where poverty is high, inequalities are aggravated by this cycle of and link between the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and poor health and low productivity.”[^2]

## Problem Statement 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand. There are two types of water scarcity: physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function.[^3] Philippines today are experiencing water supply issues and shortages caused by the recent typhoon that struck the island of Luzon are proof of the importance of forest environments, says the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Philippines.[^4]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typhoon Ulysses (International Name: Vamco) – the fourth in a series of strong storms to strike the country between the months of October and November – passed through Central Luzon, bringing with it heavy rains. Much of the land across the island of Luzon was waterlogged from the previous storms, and the additional rain brought by Ulysses led to flooding similar to what was seen during Tropical Storm Ondoy back in 2009.[^4]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As floods inundated cities across Luzon, mudslides and heavy erosion caused the waters of Ipo Dam to turn brown. This led to days of water shortages in certain areas across Metro Manila. Approximately 6 million Filipinos living in Metro Manila were affected by water shortages experienced in March of 2019 – almost half the population of the urban metropolis.[^4]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WWF-Philippines has been working with local stakeholders on forest protection and conservation efforts to mitigate massive siltation events of this scale from happening again in the future. The root systems of a healthy forest, reminds the environmental conservation organization, help in controlling soil erosion and the siltation. “There are other, less obvious reasons as well as to why these forests are important to our water supply,” added Pagaduan. “The forest cover itself is important in keeping the rains from contaminating the water we drink.” Good forest cover keeps water droplets from directly striking the ground. When rain strikes the ground directly, it dislodges more soil, sending dirt tumbling downhill into the water supply below, explained Pagaduan.[^4]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect the water supply of Metro Manila, the forests of Ipo Watershed require both protection and rehabilitation. Enforcement against illegal logging and land-use conversion is crucial to protecting the integrity of the forest, while conservation practices that ensure planted trees reach adulthood is needed to help the watershed recover. Water shortages now loom over the nation’s capital as it recovers from the damage brought by Typhoon Ulysses. As this latest crisis rolls out, conservation organizations like WWF-Philippines highlight the need for nature-based solutions and healthy forests in order to lessen the impacts of devastating storms.[^4]
